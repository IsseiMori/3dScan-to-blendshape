fbx file is complex and needs Blender or Maya to generate it
Decide to use Blender because of its accessibility

Lean Blendshape in Blender
    Create a base shape
    Shape Keys -> add
    Edit the shape

Create git repo

Use yaml in blender python
    Needs yaml module to read yaml file
    python in blender is independent and needs to install py_yaml in
    /Applications/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.79/python/lib/python3.5

    pip install pyyaml -t .
    in the directory

Start blender from terminal to see output the log (output)

Reading yml file in blender
    current directory in blender python is python in blender, not where current project is at

    filepath = bpy.data.filepath
    directory = os.path.dirname(filepath)
    print(directory+'/facelandmarks.yml')

    to get the current project directory

    Scan error with facelandmarks.yml
        simple yaml file opens
        yml or yaml doesn't matter

        %YAML:1.0
        ---

        !!opencv-matrix

        tabs 

        causing error

        delete !!opencv-matrix and %YAML:1.0 ---
        it loads

Read pairs of 3 data and create cubes as vertices

Create good topology faces from the vertices

Blendshape the faces with a common texture

Blendshape textures
    Texture -> Diffuse -> Color can merge multiple textures

    ISSUE: What is 50%?
        50% of a face with wrinkles and no wrinkles is 50% transparency wrinkles
        then what is 50% of an eye at position A and B? not half A and half B. It's between AB
        -> this maybe not a problem if UVs are correctly morphed

UVs are not blendshaping SOLVE THIS
    Aligned textures from sasi shares the same UVs
    Use Hoi's UV for everything


Mixing multiple textures
    Node editor MixShader with two ImageTexture

Linking ShapeKey and MixShader value
    Add driver to shapeKey
    In Graph editor, link the path of MixShader value

Driver value not updated instantly
    launch blender --enable-new-depsgraph

Smooth Shading
    edit mode->mesh->faces->shade smooth
